## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:




```{r}
# library the package

library(irr)
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)


```

```{r}
# read in the dataset

IAA = read.csv(file = "/Users/biaoyun/Documents/calculate_IAA/Mood_180_IAA_checker.csv", sep = ",", encoding="UTF-8")


```

```{r}

IAA = subset(IAA, select = -c(id, text, checker))


```

```{r}

# calculate percentage agreement

agree(IAA)

```

```{r}
# calculate Cohen’s kappa

kappa2(IAA)

# By convention, if the p value is less than 0.05, people will generally believe you when you assert that the two raters agreed more than would be expected by chance. If the p value is greater than 0.05, people will generally be skeptical.

# 

```



```{r}
# calculate Fleiss’s kappa

#Fleiss = kappam.fleiss(IAA, exact = FALSE, detail = FALSE)
#Fleiss

```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
